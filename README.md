# vue-ui-code-challenge

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

(Note if using nvm use the following command)

```sh
nvm use 20.3.0
```

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```

# Interface Development Test

## Design assets
* Invision public URL: https://invis.io/N312IJ0C8GMK
* Assets used in the build have been packaged under the `/assets` folder.

## Test instructions
In the linked Invision page you will find the designs for two components. Complete the following:
* The code should be submitted via a github account. Bonus points for more than one commit.
* Build the two blocks using modern HTML5 standards.
* Use JavaScript to capture all anchor clicks, and `console.log()` the element which has been clicked.
* As with any modern web-build we expect a level of interactivity/animation to be displayed on the nodes.
* All content areas should be deemed as being populated from a CMS - so all copy lengths can vary!

## Technologies
* Any CSS-preprocessors or frameworks.
* ES5 or ES6+ acceptable.
* Please include some reasoning for the decisions via comments or readme.
* Build tools and task runners are encouraged (e.g. grunt/gulp/webpack).

## Layout
* The layout is expected to work in the latest Chrome/FireFox/Edge versions.
* The layout should be responsive and work down to a `320px` mobile device.
* Bearing in mind that this application is expected to be responsive, the developer should consider the appropriate `<meta>` tags.
* **Section: All the latest:** Assume these items need anchor tags, but have no link defined.
* **Section: Answer your body's needs:** Each image in this section should display in a modal on click.

## Review Criteria
We are looking for your ability to bring life to static designs. During that process consider the following:
* **Project structure:** Clean project and logical traversal.
* **JavaScript:** Efficiency of code and efficacy in bringing the design to life.
* **Interface:** Semantic markup styling.
* **Git:** Bonus points for submission on a github account showing multiple commits.
* **Quality:** Production-grade build and precision.
